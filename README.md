# Vinylizer
Vinylizer is a vinyl crackle plugin that we have created to be easy to use something and inexpensive so that everyone can get a desired vinyl crackle effect. We created a standard vinyl sound in juce, so with the press of the middle button on the jukebox you can add a vintage vinyl crackle to any midi track or instrument across all DAWs. 
# Key Features
The plugin does not include any user-controllable parameters, only a bypass button that you can use to enable/bypass the plugin’s effect. This is so Vinylizer is easy for anyone at any skill level to use. We have shaped white noise through sine equations so that you don’t have to! We’ve listened to vinyl records and researched what’s out there to create the most authentic vinyl crackle out for musicians of all abilities to explore and mess around with. I find most plugins intimidating and hard to use and get the grasp of. We wanted to make something that people wanted to play with and use and not be scared of using. Press the button in the centre of the image to activate the effect and the vinyl crackle can be applied to the start/end of a song, to a midi track or to an instrument in logic, ableton or any desired DAW.
